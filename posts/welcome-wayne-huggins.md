Preferred job qualifications for Ippon Technologies USA’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Director: be [Wayne Huggins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waynehuggins/). Finding someone to fill a new strategic position who checks all the boxes for required skills and prior experience, and perfectly fits the corporate culture is not easy. But we found that in Wayne. Continue reading to learn why we’re so excited to have him on the team.

Wayne’s educational background includes a bachelor’s from Virginia Military Institute in Business and Economics, as well as three master’s degrees from Liberty University in Divinity, Religion, and Business Administration. After serving in the Air Force, he became a Business Analyst at Owens & Minor, where he worked on digital projects and rolling out Oracle ERP. This eventually led him to move to Paris, France to be Head of IT for Movianto, a division of O&M. Little did he know that in a few years he would be working for another company with Parisian influence. (hint: that’s us!)

In 2015, Wayne moved back to the United States to help build [Core Consulting](http://www.coremgmt.com/), a Richmond-based company, from the ground up. He grew the business by $3.5 million, focusing on strategy and delivery. After a year and a half with Core, Wayne’s next opportunity came knocking.

With a desire to get closer to the technical side of business, Wayne accepted a position with us as our Mid-Atlantic Regional Director. His previous experience in building a comprehensive business strategy and his background in delivery made him the ideal candidate for this new position. “It’s a really great learning opportunity. I get to work with the best engineers out there on the most innovative technologies with some of the most innovative customers in the world,” says Huggins.

Wayne hit the ground running on his June 5th start date. His leadership experience and ability to gain people’s trust though the building of relationships will be crucial as we continue to canvas the East Coast.

In his First 100 Days, Wayne’s plan is to meet and get to know everyone on the Ippon Technologies USA team, as well as meet all of our clients and understand their needs and pain points. He also plans to develop a comprehensive strategy, not to change Ippon or the mid-Atlantic region, but to make sure that we are scalable and that we are growing responsibly, while maintaining a culture of innovation and learning. He has already made a trip to Charlotte to spark new business initiatives and to Paris to visit our global headquarters.

Wayne’s long-term plans for Ippon include growing into a national organization that operates globally. We will be comprised of multiple regions that work together within the United States to form an international technology innovation powerhouse. Ippon will not only bring specialized capabilities in Java, Big Data, and Cloud, but also an understanding of how to use those technologies to solve global problems for global companies by leveraging Ippon’s global network.

Pretty exciting, right? Here’s even more good news. We’re always looking for smart, innovative, and quirky people to join our team in NYC, DC, Richmond, and Charlotte. If Wayne’s plans for the future of Ippon resonate with you, drop us a note at [careers@ippon.tech](mailto:careers@ippon.tech).
